# TODO: Chaotic Idle Game Development Roadmap

This document outlines future development tasks and ideas for the chaotic idle game.

## I. Core Gameplay Enhancements

*   **BigNumber Implementation:**
    *   [x] Integrate a robust BigNumber library (e.g., `break_infinity.js`, `decimal.js`) to handle very large numbers that will inevitably arise in an idle game. This is crucial for long-term playability.
    *   [x] Refactor existing calculations (`baseCurrency`, generator `count`, `cost`, `production`) to use the chosen BigNumber library.
*   **Saving and Loading:**
    *   [x] Implement game state saving to LocalStorage.
    *   [x] Implement loading game state from LocalStorage on page load.
    *   [ ] Consider adding manual save/export and import options (e.g., as a text string).
*   **More Generator Tiers:**
    *   [~] Design and implement additional generator tiers (Tiers 1-4 implemented).
    *   [ ] Ensure the "N produces N-1" mechanic scales appropriately.
    *   [ ] Balance costs and production rates for new tiers.
    *   [x] Tier 1-4 names and roles to be updated for new theme.
*   **Unlock Mechanics Refinement:**
    *   [~] Implement more diverse unlock conditions for new generators or features (e.g., reaching a certain amount of a specific resource, owning X of multiple generator types, total time played).
    *   [ ] Provide clear UI feedback for locked elements, showing unlock requirements.
    *   [x] Unlock conditions for Tiers 2, 3, and 4 implemented. (Assuming Tier 4 unlock was done)
*   **Offline Progress:**
    *   [x] Calculate progress made while the game was closed (based on `lastUpdate` timestamp).
    *   [x] Present offline gains to the player upon reloading the game.

## II. Speed of Light Theme Integration

*   [x] Define core thematic elements: JuLs (energy), Rapidity (Ï†), Ship Speed (v/c).
*   [x] Rename existing generators and resources to fit the new theme.
*   [x] Implement Rapidity calculation and display.
*   [ ] Future: Explore mechanics related to relativistic effects (time dilation, length contraction) as potential prestige layers or boosts.
*   [ ] Future: Consider if specific ship components or research could unlock new abilities or improve efficiency, tying into the speed of light theme.

## III. UI/UX Improvements

*   **Dynamic Generator Display:**
    *   [x] Modify `script.js` to dynamically create HTML elements for generators from the `gameData.generators` array instead of having them hardcoded in `index.html`. This makes adding new tiers much easier.
*   **Number Formatting:**
    *   [x] Improve `formatNumber()` to use standard abbreviations for large numbers (K, M, B, T, aa, ab, etc.) or scientific notation.
*   **Notifications/Feedback:**
    *   [ ] Add a dedicated notification area for events like unlocking new tiers, affording new upgrades, or "not enough resources."
*   **Cost Indicators:**
    *   [ ] Visually indicate if a player can afford a purchase (e.g., button color changes).
*   **Detailed Stats Panel:**
    *   [ ] Create a more comprehensive statistics panel showing total production rates, counts of everything, time played, prestige currency, etc.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   [ ] Continuously test and refine responsiveness, especially as new UI elements are added. Ensure absurd elements don't break mobile layouts.

## IV. "Chaos" Element & Absurdity

*   **Chaotic Events (Optional):**
    *   [ ] Introduce random (but perhaps seeded/predictable for fairness) events that temporarily alter game rules or production rates (e.g., "A rogue anomaly just doubled your JuL production for 30 seconds!", "A paradigm shift has made Morphisms 10x cheaper!").
*   **Absurd Upgrades:**
    *   [ ] Design upgrades with humorous or nonsensical descriptions that still provide tangible benefits.
*   **Visual Absurdity:**
    *   [ ] Lean into the "absurd and grandiose" design. Are there more non-functional but visually entertaining elements to add? (Ensure they don't hinder performance too much).

## V. Code Quality & Refactoring

*   **Modularity:**
    *   [ ] Continue to separate concerns in JavaScript (e.g., UI update logic, game state logic, utility functions). Consider splitting into multiple JS files if `script.js` becomes too large.
*   **Comments and Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Keep code well-commented, especially for complex logic or thematic tie-ins.
*   **Performance:**
    *   [ ] Profile performance as the game grows, especially the game loop and UI updates, to ensure it remains smooth.

This list is a starting point and will evolve as the game develops. Prioritize based on what feels most impactful for the next stage of development!
